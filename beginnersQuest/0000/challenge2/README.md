the challenge says: "we use our alphabet too frequently, let's try an alternative one", this means that the cipher is most likely a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, which means each letter
in the alphabet is replaced with another one and the cipher is constructed from this. We can deduce which letter is transformed into which by analyzing the frequency 
of letters. For example, the most common letter in english is "e", the most commong letter in the cipher is "x", this means that e is most likely transformed into x in the cipher
text. we can use an online tool that does this analysis for us, we can find one in boxentriq.com
